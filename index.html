	<h1>Welcome to Yingcheng's Domain</h1>
	<p>I am currently a Statistics master student at University of Chicago. I am interested in tennis, movies, apple ciders 
		and computational & inferential methods in high dimensional data, especially human genomics. </p>
	<p>If I do get into a PhD program, I would like to become a research scientist that focuses on the application of genomics data in disease early diagnosis and treatment. </p>
	<p>This is a reminder that I need to find a better picture.</p>
